The database is accessible at: http://nosql.kis.agh.edu.pl:5984, if you connect from outside of the AGH network, you will need a VPN connection. Login: admin, password: ztb2020.

While using curl you could provide the credentials as part of URI:

curl http://admin:ztb2020@nosql.kis.agh.edu.pl:5984/_all_dbs
or

curl -u 'admin:ztb2020' http://nosql.kis.agh.edu.pl:5984/_all_dbs
Actually, as basic access authentication is used, sends base64-encoded credentials within the HTTP header (admin:ztb2020 is encoded as: YWRtaW46enRiMjAyMA==), which can also be done directly as:

curl -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46enRiMjAyMA==' http://nosql.kis.agh.edu.pl:5984/_all_dbs
It is strongly recommended to use the web interface first, though: http://nosql.kis.agh.edu.pl:5984/_utils/

Preparation
Although we all use the same credentials for authentication, each of you should have a separate database.

Please create a database with a unique name (e.g. your name and/or surname, nickname, preferred handle, etc.) and use it for the exercise.

Exercises
You are developing a shopping list application.

Insert into the database the following documents. The documents that have the following attributes: product, price and store represent items on a shopping list.

{"product":"bread", "price": 2.2, "store":"Biedronka", "when":"weekly"}     
{"product":"tomato", "price": 2, "store":"Biedronka", "when":"weekly"}
{"product":"tomato", "price": 3, "store":"Lidl", "when":"weekly"}
{"product":"tomato", "price": 4, "store":"Auchan", "when":"weekly"}
{"product":"moon rocket", "price": 119, "store":"Auchan", "description":"Black and White Falcon Heavy"}
{"product":"lollipop", "price": 1.2, "store":"Lidl"}
{"product":"lollipop", "price": 1.4, "store":"Biedronka"}
{"product":"trash", "store":"Biedronka"}
{"book":"Alice in Wonderland", "price": 22.4, "store":"Biedronka"}

    

        
Write a view that presents store name, product name and price sorted according to the store's name. Documents that do not have the required attributes should be ignored.

Write a view that counts number of items to buy in each store. Documents that do not have the required attributes should be ignored.

Write a view which calculates an average price of each product (mind reduce/rereduce; calculating it might be tricky, ask for assistance if needed). Documents that do not have the required attributes should be ignored.

What is the URL which shows all items to buy at Lidl?

What is the URL which shows how many items is to buy at Biedronka?
